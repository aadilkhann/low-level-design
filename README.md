# 🧠 Low Level Design (LLD) Practice Repository

This repository contains structured notes, design patterns, SOLID principles, and practical low-level design questions implemented in Java. It's part of my journey to master software architecture and system design.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse any pattern or principle folder.
2. View its `README.md` (or `.java`) to understand the code and concept.
3. Use Mermaid live editor or IntelliJ plugins to render UML diagrams.
4. Link GitHub file in your Notion notes for revision.
